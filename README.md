## 🌟 Overview

**Imagine this scenario:** you are watching or listening to media and want to save a portion of it. 

**Bee's Power Media** is a desktop application for Windows that cuts the desired portions and converts media files between formats (containers) with **zero quality loss** using copy streams technology. No re-encoding means conversions are 10-100x faster than tools that re-encode media.

Currently in active development - watch this space! ⭐
